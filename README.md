Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing stiffness, swelling, and chronic pain. When conventional treatments such as pain relievers, exercise, and physical therapy fail to provide relief, Euflexxa injections offer a promising alternative.

At Butler Medical Imaging, we specialize in administering Euflexxa injections to help patients manage knee osteoarthritis pain and regain mobility. Understanding how Euflexxa works, the treatment process and post-injection care is crucial for individuals considering this option.

Understanding Euflexxa Injections
Euflexxa injections are a type of viscosupplementation therapy designed to treat knee osteoarthritis pain. The active ingredient, 1% sodium hyaluronate, mimics a substance naturally found in healthy joint fluid, helping to restore lubrication and cushioning within the knee joint.

Doctors often recommend Euflexxa injections when:

✔ Pain medications (such as NSAIDs) fail to provide sufficient relief.

✔ Physical therapy and exercise have not improved joint function.

✔ Patients seek a non-surgical treatment to manage their osteoarthritis symptoms.

Administering Euflexxa injections involves injecting the hyaluronate solution directly into the affected knee joint over a series of treatments.

How Euflexxa Works
The key component of Euflexxa, sodium hyaluronate, functions as both a:

✔ Lubricant – Reducing friction in the joint, allowing for smoother movement.

✔ Shock absorber – Helping the knee joint withstand pressure and impact.

Osteoarthritis reduces the natural hyaluronic acid in joint fluid, leading to stiffness, friction, and pain. By replenishing joint lubrication, Euflexxa injections restore natural joint function, reducing discomfort and improving mobility.

At Butler Medical Imaging, our specialists use advanced imaging technology to ensure precise administration of Euflexxa injections, maximizing effectiveness and minimizing discomfort.

Euflexxa Treatment Process
The Euflexxa treatment process follows a structured schedule to ensure maximum pain relief and joint function improvement.

Treatment Schedule
Euflexxa injections are administered once per week for 3 to 5 weeks, depending on the severity of osteoarthritis and the patient’s response to treatment.

Consistency is key – Delaying or skipping an injection can reduce effectiveness, so it’s important to follow the treatment schedule as prescribed.

Duration of Pain Relief
Many patients begin experiencing relief as early as one week after the first injection. However, the full benefits develop gradually, peaking within 6–8 weeks after the full course of treatment.

After receiving all three Euflexxa injections, patients can expect pain relief for approximately 6 months. Some individuals may experience longer-lasting benefits with repeated courses of treatment.

Post-Injection Care
Proper post-injection care is essential to optimize the effectiveness of Euflexxa injections and prevent unnecessary complications.

What to Do After a Euflexxa Injection
·         Rest the knee – Avoid excessive movement for at least 24-48 hours.

·         Apply ice packs – If mild pain or swelling occurs, apply ice for 15–20 minutes several times a day.

·         Use mild pain relievers – Paracetamol can help with any post-injection discomfort (avoid NSAIDs unless prescribed).

What to Avoid After a Euflexxa Injection
❌ High-impact activities – No running, jumping, or strenuous exercises for 48 hours.

❌ Prolonged standing or heavy lifting – Avoid standing for more than one hour at a time.

❌ Excessive knee stress – Do not engage in weight-bearing activities that put a strain on the joint.

By following these post-injection guidelines, patients can enhance the effectiveness of Euflexxa injections and achieve longer-lasting pain relief.

Follow-Up Care and Monitoring
·         Regular follow-up appointments are recommended to monitor progress and determine if additional treatments are needed.

·         Follow-up 6 months after the final injection – At this appointment, the doctor will evaluate whether another round of Euflexxa injections is necessary.

·         If pain relief diminishes before six months, patients should consult with their doctor to explore alternative treatments or additional Euflexxa injections at Butler Medical Imaging.
